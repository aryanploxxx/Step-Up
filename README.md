## Kill The Cliché
  It is a general belief that gamers are couch potatoes who are spending most of their time sitting in front of their computer screens and are becoming unhealthy and   unfit day by day.
  
  Generally games do not promote fitness which has an unhealthy impact on the youth especially kids.
  
  Step Up kills this cliché by promoting health and fitness among its users.
  
  It is an application cum game of its kind where the more you burn your calories by walking,running or jogging, the more you win.
